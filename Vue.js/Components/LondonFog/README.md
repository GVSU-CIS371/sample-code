# London Fog Vue 3 + TypeScript Example

Welcome to the London Fog Vue 3 + TypeScript example repository! This project showcases how to build a "London Fog" tea component using Vue 3 and TypeScript. It's inspired by and based on the original tutorial by Divya Sasidharan. You can watch her insightful tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xF_JHb5oc).

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a Node.js environment set up. You have two options:

1. **Docker Container**: For a containerized development environment, refer to our detailed setup instructions in the class slides.
2. **Direct Install**: Install Node.js directly from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GVSU-CIS371/london-fog.git
cd london-fog
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Launch the local development server to see the application in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```
